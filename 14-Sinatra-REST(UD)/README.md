* Explain REST (Representational State Transfer)
   - Convention of naming files and paths
   - Template for the path + views
   - Architecture pattern (Convention over configuration)

* Demonstrate how REST is used with CRUD
* Build out CRUD using Sinatra

# RESTful CRUD
* Reading
* New
* Creating
  * Form
  * Mass assignment
* Edit form
  * Nested params?
* Updating
  * One small caveat
* Deleting

# Params
Where does params come from? What information can be found in it?
